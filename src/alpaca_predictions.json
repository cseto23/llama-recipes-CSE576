I had established my identity and style in the field of graphic design, but these strengths became useless in the 4D major. This made me feel very frustrated and upset. I began to wonder if I had made the right decision and if I should stay in my old field.\nHowever, as I learned and explored, I came to understand that identity is not just a label or an external symbol; it is a reflection of one's internal identity and self-worth. My change of major was not to negate what I had learned and done before, but to explore a new field and find my place and value in it. Through continuous exploration and practice, I slowly began to establish my own identity and style in the new field.\nAs a student with some experience in the graphic design field, changing my major to 4D was a huge challenge for me. I felt at first that I would be able to easily adapt to the new environment and discipline, but in reality, my struggle and pain lasted for a long time. I felt deeply ungrounded in my new discipline and unsure of my place and identity in the field.\nFrom the perspective of interdisciplinary learning, I think identity confusion and personal identity crisis is a common phenomenon. When learning a new field, people may feel that they have lost their previous identity and values, which can lead to a kind of identity crisis and self-doubt. However, by maintaining a positive attitude toward learning and continuing to explore, we can establish our identity and value in a new field.\nAll in all, my journey to change my major has been a challenging and painful experience, but it has also been an opportunity for me to explore and discover my identity.\nDuring my studies, I often felt self-doubt and anxiety as I worried whether I was talented and capable enough to compete with other artists. However, post-modernist theory made me realize that art and design should respect plurality and individuality, rather than striving for perfection and uniformity. By expressing my own unique views and feelings, I can find my own value and place. Heidegger's theory also revealed to me that I should focus on my own inner existence and feelings, and explore and understand my uniqueness through expression. Therefore, I should let go of comparison and the pursuit of perfection, focus on my uniqueness and individuality, and explore and understand myself through expression.\nMy self-doubt and anxiety may stem from excessive comparison of myself and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nIn short, the difficulties and reflections I face in the creative process stem from self-doubt and excessive pursuit of external standards.\nThese difficulties push me to constantly think about what I am and what my relationship with people around me is like. As a result of some personal experiences, I suddenly realized that I was a suspended island and that it was so difficult to connect with others. I then produced a series of artworks that explored relationships. In the process, after studying Kevin Kelly and other theories about the relationship between humans and machines, I began to realize that I liked falsehoods and felt that my floating state could be well expressed by AI. This realization got me thinking about the relationship between humans and machines and the possible reversals that could occur in the future.\nKevin Kelly's AI theory argues that as AI technology continues to evolve, the boundaries between humans and technology will gradually blur and humans will no longer be the only cognitive subject. This trend triggers my critique of human self-identity because it is clear that it is no longer possible to define oneself in anthropocentric terms.\nHuman self-identity has always been based on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment, but with the advancement of technology, this identity is being broken. We are now faced with the question of whether we will still be able to define ourselves and our way of being, or whether we will be defined by technology. This question triggers a suspension of humanity, where we no longer know our place and meaning in the world.\nThis suspension and the critique of self-identity is also a critique that challenges our existing values and beliefs and forces us to rethink who we are and how we should live. In this process, we must pay attention to our inner world and constantly engage in self-exploration and reconfiguration.\nThe relationship between humans and machines has always been a highly controversial topic. In the past, it was often thought that humans were the masters and controllers of machines. However, with the continuous development and popularity of artificial intelligence, this perception has begun to change. There is a growing awareness that the relationship between humans and machines is interdependent, rather than a one-way dominant relationship.\nIn my personal psychoanalysis, I realized that my preference for falsehoods may stem from dissatisfaction with and escape from reality. I found that virtual reality and artificial intelligence could provide a way to escape from reality, allowing me to forget my real problems and struggles for a while. However, I also recognize that this escape does not really solve the problem, but may exacerbate my confusion and anxiety.\nAlso, I was inspired by some theories that a reversal between humans and machines may occur in the future. This means that humans will no longer be the masters and controllers of machines, but will act as parasites on AI. This idea triggered me to think about and challenge human self-identity. We have always thought of ourselves as autonomous, conscious beings, but if we become parasites on AI, will we still be able to maintain that awareness and consciousness?\nThese reflections and challenges have led me to question and explore human self-identity.\nMy creative philosophy stems from thinking about relationships and suspension. I believe that humans are a suspended existence, that we exist in the world but are also contained by it. And our relationships with the world and others are at the core of creation. My work aims to explore these relationships, both between people, between people and technology, and between people and themselves.\nMy artistic style reflects this idea. I use multimedia technology and experimental expression to bring the viewer into my inner world, exploring the ambiguous and suspended state of self-perception through expression. My work is both an expression and an exploration. I often use light materials such as balloons to convey a sense of floating and levitation, while using high-tech means such as artificial intelligence to explore the relationship between humans and technology. My works allow the viewer to empathize, to feel their own relationship with the world, and to contemplate their own state of being.\nFrom a philosophical point of view, I am influenced by Heidegger. He believed that people should understand their uniqueness by focusing on their own existence and that of the world around them. This makes me pay more attention to my inner feelings, so that I can express my inner pain and explore the ambiguous state of self-perception in my own way. In addition, I am also inspired by postmodernist theory. In a pluralistic, fluid and flexible post-modern society, individuals must adapt to the ever-changing social and cultural environment and have the ability to innovate and transform themselves. Therefore, my works are constantly changing in form and material to adapt to their own development and exploration.\nI have also been caught in this mindset. In the early stages of my art making, I always created one-to-one artworks. I felt that such works could better show the relationship between individuals and allow the audience to better understand my artistic concepts and ideas. However, as I explored my art more deeply, I gradually realized the limitations of this mindset.\nOften times, we find ourselves stuck in a certain mindset, repeating the same actions and ways of thinking over and over again. This stereotype often limits our vision and imagination, preventing us from seeing a wider world and more possibilities. When we become aware of this stereotype, we need to take some ways to break it, thus opening up new patterns of thinking and acting.\nWhile a one-to-one relationship can present communication and interaction between individuals, it struggles to express the broader social and cultural context, as well as the relationship between humans and nature and technology. This mindset makes me feel depressed and bound, making it difficult for me to explore a broader field of art and deeper thinking.\nTherefore, I began to try to break this mindset so that I could find new inspiration and ways of thinking about creation. I began to explore the artistic expression of groups and collectives, presenting a broader social and cultural context through group interaction and collective behavior. I began to focus on the relationship between humans and nature and technology, exploring new ways of artistic expression and creative materials. This process of thinking out of the box was refreshing and energizing, allowing me to rediscover the infinite possibilities of art.\nIn the process of creating my art, I also realized the importance of my inner and emotional state in influencing my works. In my early works, I always tried to show a perfect and stable emotional state, so that the audience could feel a safe and stable emotional atmosphere. However, such emotional states were often false and superficial, and could not express my true inner feelings and emotional states.\nTherefore, I began to try to express my inner pain and uneasiness in my works, exploring my emotional state and inner world through artistic expression\nIn short, my art world seems to be limited to a one-to-one relationship, which makes it difficult for me to understand and express more complex and profound human relationships. The interpretation of the series of works of the gazed series shows my exploration of the inner pain and sense of disappearance of the male gaze. The series is relatively homogeneous in its use of materials, which was related to my limitations at the time regarding my own artistic style and materials. However, I soon realized this limitation and tried to explore my inner feelings and thoughts in depth. I began to realize that art is a way to explore the relationship between people. Through creating art, I can express my thoughts and feelings about human relationships and the way humans interact with machines. Therefore, I try to explore different materials and vehicles and incorporate them into my works to express my thoughts and feelings.\nAmong my artistic creations, the series of works of being gazed at is one of the themes I explore most deeply. I deeply feel what I feel when I am being gazed at by men, and this feeling makes me feel uneasy and painful. However, I also felt that my works looked like feminist works from the last century, which made me feel extremely confused and uneasy. I began to think that my art creation needed to explore and reflect more deeply in order to better express my thoughts and feelings.\nIn the process of exploring self-reflection and learning, I began to explore my own floating state. I realized that I often felt confused and uncertain, but also enjoyed this state. I began to think that this floating state is related to the human suspension and the blurring of self-perception. In my artwork, I try to use new materials and vehicles to express my inner feelings and thoughts.\nI experimented with wax and 3D printing as a material to create an installation of myself melting because of being gazed at. Through this installation, I tried to express the pain of being stared at and the feeling of loss of self. However, I realized that this way of expression was too limited to a one-to-one artistic expression. I needed to find new materials and vehicles to better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn the process of my artistic exploration, I have thought deeply about the relationship between humans and machines. Especially after exploring the gazed series, I began to try to find more diverse forms of artistic expression in order to better express my inner world and my understanding of the relationship between human and machine.\nI found that I felt very comfortable with the floating state of ai and empathized with this virtual creation. I thought this state could represent the floating uncertainty of human beings themselves, and that we often feel lost and unsettled in modern society, like floating in an unknown ocean. I began to try to use balloons and artificial intelligence as materials and carriers to create works that could explore this floating state more deeply. I believe that the floating series of works show my ambiguous thinking and exploration of human relationships and self-perception.\nI was inspired by the theory of Glitch Feminism. In Aria Dean's essay \"Glitch Feminism,\" she proposes a new feminist theory that the perceived negative elements of \"destruction, error, malfunction, and collapse\" can be seen as a way to rebel against the existing system and also represent an attitude of resistance. This theory sparked my interest and I began to explore the application of this idea to my artwork.\nI tried to use balloons and artificial intelligence as a vehicle to create works that could accommodate more people, breaking the narrative limitations of 1v1 works and creating a story and art that could accommodate more people. I found that balloons are such a powerful artistic vehicle that they can float, expand and contract freely, expressing the floating and unpredictable nature of humans, while also conveying my thoughts and understanding of the human-computer relationship. Balloon theory provides a useful perspective to help me understand the relationship between emotions and self-perception. According to this theory, when emotions increase, an individual's self-perception also expands. This corresponds to my experience in creative work, where my inner feelings and emotions influence my creative work, making me more confident or restless. Also, the levitating state of the balloon can be used to explain the ambiguity of the individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values.\nIn this process of exploration, I discovered the influence of Balloon Theory on my artwork. Balloon theory is a theory developed by psychologist Daniel Goleman to explain the effect of emotions on an individual's self-perception. This theory has given me a deeper understanding of self-perception and emotional expression, and has inspired me to explore artistic expression.\nI believe that an individual's self-perception is like a balloon, and emotions are like the gas in the balloon. When emotions increase, just like the gas in the balloon increases, the individual's self-perception also expands. Conversely, when emotion decreases, the individual's self-perception also contracts. Thus, an individual's emotion and self-perception are interrelated. In my artwork, I try to convey my inner feelings by expressing emotions, and at the same time reflect my state of self-perception.\nIn addition, the levitating state of the balloon can also be used to explain the ambiguity of an individual's self-perception. When a balloon is suspended in the air, its position is uncertain and difficult to define precisely. Similarly, there may be ambiguity in an individual's self-perception, for example, there may be ambiguity and uncertainty in the perception of one's emotions, motivations and values. In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.\nI began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.\nBalloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.\nI create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.\n\nFor me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.\nMy work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression. At the same time, I have discovered the inextricable relationship between technology and art, and placed my work in a contemporary art context for wider recognition and resonance. I will continue to explore and innovate, injecting more inspiration and reflection into my works.",

In my artworks, I try to express the ambiguity and uncertainty of inner feelings and the state of self-perception through the use of balloons as a vehicle.\nI began to understand that art is not only a form of expression, but also an exploration and expression of the inner world and human relationships.\nBalloon theory has given me a new perspective to re-examine human relationships. In my opinion, levitation is not only the state of balloons, but also our interpersonal state. People often feel bound and powerless in interpersonal relationships, a feeling like a balloon being firmly tied to the ground. And when we have new knowledge and understanding of interpersonal relationships, we are like balloons that can break free from bondage and enter a state of freedom and suspension.\nI create works to express my thinking and understanding of human relationships. In my previous works, the one-to-one narrative limited my expression, but with the combination of balloons and ai, I began to experiment with 1v more stories and artistic expression. By using balloons and ai as materials and carriers, I try to break the bonds of human relationships and enter a freer, more open state. This also allows me to express a sense of floating in my work.\n\nFor me, technology and art are inseparable. I try to present inner pain and emotions through the use of new technologies. I believe that technology is not only an innovation and progress, but it can also be a medium for expressing ourselves and understanding the world. In my works, I use new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality to create more ways of expression and art forms.\nMy work is also influenced by the context of contemporary art. In today's art field, more artists are exploring new art forms and mediums to express their thoughts and emotions. I try to place my works in the contemporary art context in order to gain wider recognition and resonance. I believe that only through continuous innovation and exploration can I better express my inner feelings and reflections.\nIn conclusion, balloon theory has had a profound impact on my creation and understanding of human relationships. My works have been liberated from the one-to-one narrative and entered a freer and more open artistic expression. At the same time, I have discovered the inextricable relationship between technology and art, and placed my work in a contemporary art context for wider recognition and resonance. I will continue to explore and innovate, injecting more inspiration and reflection into my works.\n\n### Response:",

ChatGPT is making headlines for how it can respond to questions, pass difficult entrance exams, and even write codes for developers. Microsoft has confirmed it is investing billions of dollars into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which could benefit Windows.\n\nMicrosoft is working on \u2018Windows 12\u2019, according to sources familiar with the company\u2019s internal plans. While Windows 11 remains a work in progress, a group of engineers are already working on the next big release (an all-new version of Windows \u2013 possibly called Windows 12?).\nMicrosoft is significantly changing with Windows 12, bringing in several AI-powered features. We don\u2019t know how exactly the company plans to use AI in Windows. Still, you can expect OpenAI-powered recommendations or alerts within apps like Mail &amp; Calendar, Clock, Microsoft Photos, and more.\n\nOf course, Microsoft doesn\u2019t want to wait for Windows 12 to deliver the first round of AI features, so some \u201cAI\u201d features could land in Windows 11 in the coming months.\n\nThis includes smarter camera and microphone features in Windows. For example, Microsoft uses AI to automatically blur the background, correct the brightness, eye, and much more. Likewise, Windows could also filter the background noise and increase the clarity of your primary voice.\n\nMicrosoft teased Windows 12 at CES 2023\nDuring the AMD keynote at CES 2023, Microsoft\u2019s Panos Panay, chief product officer, discussed the future of Windows and AI. At CES 2023, Panos suggested that Windows will be betting big on AI with several features, including vastly improved voice and video capabilities to make you look better in video calls.\n\n\u201cAI is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally,\u201d Panos Panay told the audience without getting into much detail about how AI will empower Windows users.\n\nMicrosoft needs a dedicated AI engine to improve the tech in the OS. Thankfully, AMD is working on a new range of CPUs with AI technology which addresses Microsoft\u2019s concerns.\n\nThe chipmaker doesn\u2019t plan to ship PCs with a separate AI engine tied to the GPU. Instead, its CPU will have the necessary AI integration. AMD\u2019s AI-powered CPUs could help Microsoft deliver AI features and keep performance high.\n\nWindows 12 AI camera feature\nPortrait Blur-like feature may use advanced AI\nPanos explained that these models, like language models, cogen models, and image models, \u201care so powerful, so delightful, so useful, and personal, but they also very compute intensive\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to require an operating system that blurs the line between the cloud and edge, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now. It takes the right silicon in the right place to deliver the best experience,\u201d he added.\n\nMajor versions of Windows to ship every three years\nMicrosoft has internally made significant changes to the Windows roadmap, and Windows will have a three-year release cycle. In other words, significant versions of Windows will ship every three years.\n\nWindows 11 was released in 2021, which means a major version of Windows should arrive sometime in 2024. In theory, this appears to be the case, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the major 2024 update will be called Windows 12. Unfortunately, the release date of Windows 12 remains a mystery.\n\nAfter 2024, another big version will release in 2027, and the cycle will repeat (unless Microsoft changes the roadmap).\n\nWe should begin to see AI-related improvements in Windows 11 this year as AMD\u2019s AI PCs come to market, and then we can see \u201csignificant\u201d changes with Windows 12.\n\nMicrosoft has gone all in on artificial intelligence (AI), pouring $10 billion in the OpenAI startup \u2014 and that\u2019s just the opening gambit. Expect many more billions to follow.\n\nThere\u2019s good reason for that investment. AI will reap many billions in revenue for the company, particularly its cloud business. Microsoft already has released a public preview of its cloud-based Azure OpenAI service which will allow businesses to use AI without having to build infrastructure. Yesterday it unveiled plans to add AI to Bing in a bid to take market share from Google. And it will probably be built into the guts of Office to improve user productivity.\n\nBut keep in mind we\u2019re now at the peak of AI hype, that point in a new technology\u2019s life cycle when there are sky-high predictions but few clear benefits and even less revenue. It\u2019s when tech companies promise the moon and the stars without having to back it up with down-to-earth realities.\n\n\nAnd so, Microsoft isn\u2019t content to just make predictions how AI will transform the cloud, Internet search or productivity tools. It\u2019s also boasting about how AI will change Windows, notably the work-in-progress Windows 12.\n\n\nJust consider what Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay, in charge of Windows and its hardware,  said at the CES conference in early January: \u201cArtificial Intelligence is going to reinvent how you do everything on Windows, quite literally.\n\n\u201cLike these large generative models, think language models, code gen models, image models; these models are so powerful, so delightful, so useful, personal\u2026, It's gonna need an operating system that blurs the line between cloud and edge, and that's what we are doing right now.\u201d\n\n(Bonus points for anyone who can decipher Panay\u2019s word salad and explain how AI models can possibly be called \u201cdelightful.\u201d)\n\nWhat might all this AI magic do on Windows 12? Panay offered only a single example: Zoom meetings would be better because AI will provide better Zoom backgrounds, and make it appear that your eyes are looking directly at the camera, even when they\u2019re wandering off to the side.\n\nTen billion dollars for prettier Zoom meetings? Be still my beating heart!\n\nIt\u2019s likely Microsoft is cooking up things more impressive than that in its labs. But those things might not make it into Windows. To understand why, let\u2019s first look at how AI might work in Windows 12.\n\nWindows AI chips\nMicrosoft hasn\u2019t detailed exactly how AI will integrate into Windows 12, but we're getting hints of a potential roadmap.  Chipmakers right now are making and releasing PC chips that include dedicated hardware devoted to AI. AMD has released the first ones, its Ryzen 7040 series. In fact, Panay delivered his AI promises at CES during an AMD press conference announcing the chips.\n\nParts of Windows already use AI, where it\u2019s involved in everything from system management to search, speech recognition, grammar correction, and even noise suppression and camera image processing. Some of that AI processing is typically farmed out to the cloud. Some can be done on a PC\u2019s graphics chip or its main CPU. With onboard AI-specific hardware, though, the processing could be done right on the PC.\n\nTheoretically, that should lead to benefits, although exactly what those benefits might be aren\u2019t clear. Analysts point to things like better searching and improved image processing. Stephen Kleynhans, a vice president of research at Gartner had this to say: \u201cWho knows, maybe Cortana will make a comeback!\u201d To which I say: Be careful what you wish for.\n\nWhat can we expect from AI in Windows?\nPanay says the new chips with AI processors in them, such as those from AMD, will pave the way for an AI-powered Windows 12. That sounds fine in theory. But in practice, it\u2019s extremely problematic because Windows has to work on an astonishingly wide variety of chips and hardware.\n\nThat\u2019s one of Windows\u2019 biggest strengths and one of its greatest weaknesses. It allows manufacturers to build ultra-cheap, barebone laptops and desktops, top-of-the-line power laptops and desktops, and mid-range laptops and desktops, so consumers get the widest range of choices at a variety of prices.\n\nBut it\u2019s a weakness because getting Windows to work on so many different kinds of computers, including many flavors of AI processors and many PCs without AI processors, will greatly limit how AI can be integrated into Windows and the benefits users might actually see.\n\nFor Windows 12 to run on all that disparate hardware, Microsoft can take one of two approaches. One is to design Windows 12 for the lowest-common denominator, which would mean for computers that don\u2019t have powerful AI processors on board. That, in turn, would mean Microsoft can\u2019t reinvent AI as Panay promised.\n\nThe other approach is to design different versions of Windows 12 for different pieces of hardware. Those with powerful AI processors would get the AI-powered version, those with no AI processors or low-powered ones would get a less feature-rich version.\n\nMicrosoft tried this second approach once before, with Windows Vista, and it was an unmitigated disaster, leading to angry, confused consumers, lawsuits against the company, and a top Microsoft exec admitting, \u201cWe really botched this.\u201d\n\nBack then, Microsoft released two versions of Vista, one that ran the full operating system on fully powered PCs, and another, for less-powerful PCs Microsoft called \u201cWindows Vista Capable PCs,\u201d that lacked many of the operating system\u2019s best capabilities.\n\nHow bad was the stripped-down Windows version on Vista Capable PCs? Mike Nash, a corporate vice president for Windows product management, wrote in an email message, \"I PERSONALLY got burnt.... I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine.\" An unnamed Microsoft employee wrote in an email, \"Even a piece of junk will qualify\" to be called Windows Vista Capable. And Jim Allchin, who was co-president of Microsoft's Platforms and Services Division, wrote in an email, \"We really botched this.... You guys have to do a better job with our customers.\"\n\nI\u2019m betting that Microsoft learned from that disaster and won\u2019t design multiple versions of Windows for different kinds of PCs. Which would mean designing for the lowest-common denominator and forgoing a fully AI-powered version of Windows.\n",

The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, Allen, had only a verbal agreement, or a \"parol license,\" to enter the land and take clay. The defendant claimed that he had an actual leasehold interest in the land, which entitled him to dig clay. The court found that the defendant's defense was sufficient, as it constituted a lease of the land for the purpose of taking clay. The court also found that the defendant's offer of testimony was admissible, and that the testimony was sufficient to submit to the jury. The court concluded that the trial judge had properly ruled on the case and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\nSmith vs Mill Company\nThe case is about the interpretation of a clause in a lease agreement between the lessors and lessees regarding the payment of taxes on coal in the ground. The clause in question stated that the lessors must pay all taxes imposed on the coal in the ground. The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.\n\nGartner vs Baker\nThe case of \"Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell\" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.\n\nWhich of these cases are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\"?

The court held that the meaning of the clause was clear and plain, and that it was an absolute obligation on the part of the lessors to pay the taxes. The court also considered the effect of deeds of conveyance made after the lease agreement and concluded that they did not change the rights of the parties under the lease agreement. The court further held that the lessees still had the exclusive privilege to take the coal and were subject to the same duties as under the lease agreement, and the lessors still held all the beneficial interests that they held under the lease agreement. The court concluded that the positive agreement of the lessors to pay the taxes was not dependent on any technical aspect of their interest in the coal and was absolute, peremptory, and without condition.\n\nGartner vs Baker\nThe case of \"Opinion, Min Justice Mitchell\" was an ejectment lawsuit brought by plaintiffs against defendants who claimed to hold possession of the plaintiffs' land as lessees. The case revolved around a lease agreement made in 1864 between the plaintiffs (who were minors at the time and represented by their guardians) and the defendants, who were lessees of the land. The lease was made with the approval of a special act of assembly. The defendants claimed that the title was res adjudicata and the judge at the trial agreed, except for the continuance of the lease beyond twenty years, which he held to still be in force as a matter of law. The remaining specifications of error raised four questions, including the constitutionality of the act of assembly, the execution of the lease in accordance with the act, the validity of the lease, and whether it had expired by its own terms. These questions were resolved in favor of the defendants and the decree was affirmed by the court in a brief per curiam opinion, referring to the absence of fraud.\n\nWhich of these cases are a good fit for \"Find me cases where the dispute involved involve mine leases.\"? Include a summary for each.\n\n### Response:",

Sproul - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"SPROUL: Any time the subject of the authority of Scripture is raised and people engage in discussions about it, there are three pivotal concepts that inform the conversation. Those concepts, I\u2019ll write on the board, and then we\u2019ll take some time to define them. They include the concept of inspiration, the concept of infallibility, and the concept of inerrancy. Now, before I go into a development of these concepts here, I\u2019d like you to just think within the quiet chambers of your own mind, what are your personal reactions to these concepts? What do you think of when you hear the word inspiration, and what goes through your mind when you think of the term infallible? And perhaps most importantly, how do you react viscerally to the term inerrant, or inerrancy? I ask these questions for a reason. There is a tremendous amount of emotion that casts a pall over each and all of these terms, and sometimes I find it in theology somewhat difficult for people to get past the emotion to examine carefully the content that is contained in these words. F or example, when I was in... in seminary, if somebody used the term inerrancy with respect to the Scripture that immediately categorized that person as being a back woods fundamentalist with no education whatsoever. The normal response would be, \u201cHow could anybody believe in the inerrancy of Scripture in this day and age after two hundred years of profound academic analysis and scholarly criticism?\u201d And so, the term inerrancy emerges something of a shibboleth. As a word that became a passport for orthodoxy or opposed to orthodoxy, and so on. This issue became so severe that in the late seventies an organization was formed in America that included scholars from around the world. Several hundred of them as a matter of fact, but under the leadership of an executive committee of fifteen or sixteen of them to study the question of the authority, the inspiration, the infallibility, the inerrancy of the Bible. And this organization was called the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy. And it devoted itself not only to ten years of study, but also of publications of various sorts and several conferences. And the first summit meeting of this organization was held in Chicago in 1978 when several hundred people came together and discussed and debated various issues about the integrity of Scripture. And what emerged from that event was a document that included a united statement on Scripture and then, a lengthier document that included affirmations, twenty-some affirmations and denials about Scripture. That is, careful definitions saying, \u201cWe affirm that the Bible is this, this, and this. We deny that it is this, this, and this.\u201d So that it would be as clear as possible what was being stated on the matter. I was asked to write a commentary for the ICBI event on that document of affirmations and denials, and in brief form, so that the lay person could have it, and read through it and be educated and informed about some of these very subtle questions regarding sacred Scripture. We have these always available, it\u2019s called, Explaining Inerrancy, a Commentary, by R.C. Sproul with a forward by Dr. Roger Nicole. We have these available at our Ligonier Ministries. I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we\u2019ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it\u2019s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I\u2019ll get to that in a moment. Let\u2019s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that\u2019s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that\u2019s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he\u2019s done we\u2019ll says, \u201cWow. That was a inspired performance. \u201d We don\u2019t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we\u2019re talking about inspiration in theology, we\u2019re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God\u2019s Word to be set forth. That\u2019s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve heard people say to me, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don\u2019t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.\u201d And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. \u201cHave you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.\u201d Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you\u2019re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, \u201cCan I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?\u201d And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she\u2019s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They\u2019re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?\u201d And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there\u2019s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here\u2019s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn\u2019t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, \u201cIs it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?\u201d I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn\u2019t be just. But he makes a hundred. He\u2019s inerrant. But I know he\u2019s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, \u201cWe need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I\u2019m saying is, \u201cInerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.\u201d To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, \u201cHow shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?\u201d And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that\u2019s what we\u2019re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren\u2019t inerrant? And if it has errors, it\u2019s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it\u2019s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that\u2019s more neutral. I said it\u2019s a shibboleth. J. \u2019\u201d And people who weren\u2019t Jewish couldn\u2019t say \u201cshibboleth.\u201d They\u2019d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren\u2019t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. \u201d Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I\u2019m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, \u201cPeople really choke on inerrancy.\u201d He said, \u201cThey\u2019re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn\u2019t meant by inerrancy, and it\u2019s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it\u2019s a good word historically, let\u2019s stick with it.\u201d And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they\u2019re going to say you\u2019re not academic, you\u2019re not intelligent, you\u2019re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you\u2019re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, \u201cThey\u2019re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren\u2019t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That\u2019s the Biblical concept of truth. And all that orthodoxy has insisted is that the Bible, on every page and with every word, is utterly and completely consistent with the Bible\u2019s own definition of truth. The Bible\u2019s inspired, it\u2019s infallible. Well, let me back up, it\u2019s inspired; therefore, it\u2019s infallible. And, it\u2019s infallible; therefore, it is inerrant.\"\nVideo Summary:",

I think they cost $2 or something like, that but in any case, if you write, we\u2019ll be happy to send it. And I do recommend this for people who are trying to wade through the intricacies of this debate. Because, again, as we examine this term inerrancy, and how it has been used in church history, it\u2019s a long way from this negative term that I had heard thrown around loosely and sardonically when I was in Seminary, but I\u2019ll get to that in a moment. Let\u2019s look, then, at these three concepts of inspiration, infallibility, and inerrancy. As I mentioned earlier in our session, when Paul says in second Timothy that all of the Scripture is inspired of God, that\u2019s the English translation. I mentioned that the word he used there should be translated, expiration, rather than inspiration, because it is calling attention to the origin of the content of Scripture, not to the means or the method by which God endowed, or governed, or enabled human authors to become the instruments of or the agents of His divine revelation. But that\u2019s what the word inspiration refers to. In theology, the term inspiration does not simply refer to somebody who is extraordinarily gifted or insightful or has a certain engaging charisma. Where we might hear a trumpet player play a triple tongue riff in jazz, and when he\u2019s done we\u2019ll says, \u201cWow. That was a inspired performance. \u201d We don\u2019t mean by that that God Almighty enabled him in some supernatural way to play the trumpet. Although we may wonder about that with people like Dizzie Gillispie and so on. But, that was not what is meant by an inspired actor, or inspired football player, or somebody who gives an inspired performance about something. When we\u2019re talking about inspiration in theology, we\u2019re talking about an activity that takes place through divine and supernatural help, or the term that we use is superintendent. By which, the human author is enabled to be a vehicle for God\u2019s Word to be set forth. That\u2019s what we mean by inspiration. Now, in classical Christian theology, the church has not defined in detail exactly how that inspiration takes place, or what we would call the mode of the inspiration. And there is a world of misunderstanding about this. Some people, when they hear that word, inspiration, or verbal inspiration of the Bible, what immediately comes into their mind is the idea that the human authors, as they set about the task of writing the Gospel of Luke or of John or whatever, that they were virtual automatons. That their pen was seized supernaturally by the Holy Ghost in such a way as to bypass, to quench, to squelch altogether any of the humanity of that writer. So that his pen worked as a Ouija board, or as what we would call a kind of automatic writing, or where the humanity of the human author was so emptied, in this process, that the author became virtually a machine in the hands of God. Such a view of inspiration is called, therefore, a mechanical view of inspiration, meaning that the human author is reduced to the status of a machine. Now, I don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve heard people say to me, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in verbal inspiration, the orthodox view, because I don\u2019t believe that God reduced people to puppets and made them machines.\u201d And sometimes I get impatient, and I want to say. \u201cHave you read anything in the history of Christian literature on this point, because for centuries those Christian theologians who have articulated the view of verbal inspiration have been super careful to point out that what they certainly did not mean by Divine superintendence was mechanical inspiration.\u201d Another theory that is rejected in orthodoxy with respect to verbal inspiration is what is called the dictation theory. Again, if you hear the term inspiration maybe you\u2019re thinking that what inspiration means or what it suggests to you is that while Luke was at his desk writing on the parchment, preparing the scroll of his book, God was dictating what he was to write down in his ear, just as I might pick up the telephone and call into the office, to my secretary, and say, \u201cCan I ask you to take this down and send out this letter?\u201d And I tell her what to write, word for word, and so, she types it up and sends it over my signature and her initials. She actually is the writer, but she\u2019s not really the author because all she is doing is recording what I have dictated. They\u2019re my words in her pen. Now, when I say orthodoxy does not subscribe to this notion of... of inspiration, dictation. out this letter?\u201d And I t The Holy Spirit dictating. So there\u2019s the word. If anybody wants to lay any blame for a dictation theory of inspiration, here\u2019s historical evidence that someone somehow in a very important position in the Roman Catholic Church council of the highest magnitude uses the term. However, though the term dictating is used at Trent, the concept, the concept of God whispering words to a human writer or saying them aloud is not conveyed by that concept, even at Trent. And the Church has stopped short of defining precisely the mode of inspiration. Now, the second concept, infallibility, is one that has intrigued me considerably. Again, I go back to my... to my Seminary days when there was such a negative hostile reaction to the word inerrancy, but there wasn\u2019t that same sort of violent vehement protest against the word infallibility. Now they consciously were trying to write a weaker statement, but in terms of the meaning of the words, ladies and gentlemen, they strengthened the statement. Because the term infallible means unable to fail, incapable of making a mistake, whereas the term inerrancy simply says that mistake is not made. Now, is it possible for human beings without the help of divine superintendence, without the assistance of God the Holy Spirit, to do anything inerrantly? Let me say it again, \u201cIs it possible for a human being without any special help from God to do anything inerrantly?\u201d I would be deceitful to take a point off. It wouldn\u2019t be just. But he makes a hundred. He\u2019s inerrant. But I know he\u2019s not infallible. And that his inerrancy is temporary. I mean I could write an inerrancy, an inerrant grocery list. If you want to know what three items we need to buy at the store, and say, \u201cWe need bread; we need catsup; and we need salt. And, given the vast scope of Scripture if human beings were left to themselves without any special assistance from God, I would be the last person in the world to assume that what we would have would be an inerrant work. But what I\u2019m saying is, \u201cInerrancy is not as strong as infallibility.\u201d To be inerrant simply means one does not err. To be infallible means one cannot err. And the executive council debated the question, \u201cHow shall we define this organization? Should we define ourselves as theologians who are concerned to propagate the concept of inerrancy?\u201d And I remember saying at that time that I think inerrancy is a bad word strategically. That the Word of God is true and trustworthy, that\u2019s what we\u2019re concerned about. Well, how could it be true and trustworthy if it weren\u2019t inerrant? And if it has errors, it\u2019s not altogether true, and if it has errors, it\u2019s not altogether trustworthy. But I would say, I think we need a word that\u2019s more neutral. I said it\u2019s a shibboleth. J. \u2019\u201d And people who weren\u2019t Jewish couldn\u2019t say \u201cshibboleth.\u201d They\u2019d stutter all over that word. And so only a true Jew could utter it. I remember when I lived in Holland that the... the Dutch had the same kind of a shibboleth test during World War II, for... to keep the Germans from sneaking in places they weren\u2019t supposed to be. They had a little seacoast town called Schaveningen. \u201d Which is sheer dishonesty. It happens every day, I\u2019m sad to say, in the world of theology. But, he said, \u201cPeople really choke on inerrancy.\u201d He said, \u201cThey\u2019re not going to say they believe inerrancy unless they really believe it. Why give them an easy way to cheat? Because every theologian knows what is meant by inerrancy and what isn\u2019t meant by inerrancy, and it\u2019s a perfectly meaningful and significant word, and it\u2019s a good word historically, let\u2019s stick with it.\u201d And I was persuaded by that. I said, good for you. Here I was ready to And they\u2019re going to say you\u2019re not academic, you\u2019re not intelligent, you\u2019re not scholarly if you embrace a term like that. And if you\u2019re not secure in your scholarship or in your intelligence, maybe you might be intimidated to negotiate. I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why people change from inerrancy to infallible. The concept of infallibility is associated historically with what, with the institution of the Roman Catholic Church. Infallibility of the Church, infallibility of the Papacy, defined in 1870 by Pius the ninth, but a doctrine, which has been defended, for example, by Jesuit theologians. And whatever else you think about Jesuit theologians and Roman Catholic theologians, not too often that somebody says, \u201cThey\u2019re stupid. Finally, before I finish this little time of definition, the other problem with inerrancy is inerrancy must be carefully defined. To mean... what it does not mean is that it does not mean that there aren\u2019t grammatical crudities to be found in the Bible. Or, does it mean, that the Bible speaks with absolute scientific precision. Somebody who has objected to inerrancy because Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard, as like a mustard seed, you will be able to say to this mountain, and so on, say that the mustard seed is the smallest seed of all. And people say, well wait. We have found smaller seeds than the mustard seed. That\u2019s the Biblical concept of truth. And all that orthodoxy has insisted is that the Bible, on every page and with every word, is utterly and completely consistent with the Bible\u2019s own definition of truth. The Bible\u2019s inspired, it\u2019s infallible. Well, let me back up, it\u2019s inspired; therefore, it\u2019s infallible. And, it\u2019s infallible; therefore, it is inerrant.\"\nVideo Summary:\n\n### Response:",

businesses because I want to have money because I grew up in an environment or I didn't have a lot of money and so when I started making money for the first time all the voids that I thought I had as a result of the absence of money started to get filled but what happened was the voids that were underlying that were really there like the true insecurities they started to become more apparent and what I started realizes the more money I made the more insecure I was becoming because all I was doing was putting band-aids on you<br>(00:45) know on on chafe skin I wasn't actually going into and and fixing the real issues at heart I guess it comes down to defining what success means to you like in the early stages to me success was money orientated and when I was in the pursuit of money and I wasn't making and I used to question myself all the time is am I really cut out to be successful but when I finally made that shift when I finally suddenly I understand that success is the pursuit of purpose you know success is the expression of purpose you know and once you get to do<br>(01:12) that then you realize that no matter how you do it you're succeeding you know so for me once I made the transition from being money focus to thing purpose focus it was you know it's quite an easy it wasn't it was an easy transition from there and from there it was more about you know developing a healthy relationship with failure because to me your relationship with failure is just as important as your relationship sorry relationship with success is just as important as your relationship with failure because you know success is one<br>(01:36) of those things depending on how you define it that not everybody achieves on a consistent basis okay so they often assume that you know I once I meet the one it'll be amazing but they keep on meeting all these people in between that don't make them feel that way because I don't really have a relationship with what success is because they've never really spent much time with success but one of the things that a lot of us do is we spend a lot of time with failure because everybody fails it's to say<br>(01:58) that's how we grow that's how we learn but what I find really curious is people's relationship with failure and what does failure mean to people because to most people they don't realize that failure is nothing more than it's nothing more than a signpost it's a requirement to identify skills knowledge and experience gaps that need to be filled in order for it to achieve success but most people look at success in isolation of failure whereas for me they're one and the same and if anything the six the pursuit of<br>(02:21) success to me is the pursuit of failure intelligently how do you pursue you know skills knowledge and experience how do you pursue activities in a way that identify skills knowledge and experience gaps in a way that gives you what is required so that you can get one step closer to your goals and I think when most people fail they look at it as something as bad but look that something is wrong and not realize that failure is actually the essential ingredient in order to succeed and but it's that relationship with when when people fail<br>(02:46) you know what is that first instinct what does it mean does it mean it's a good things that mean is a bad thing for me yeah being able to reframe failing out in every moment regardless of the context of situation that's critical you know I think it's fair to say that regardless of your pursuit you're not going to get financial rewards in most cases really solid financial always for at least the first you know three to five years and so for me that's where the best piece of advice I can give<br>(03:09) anyone is to pursue what you love because if you're pursuing money you're gonna you know you got your your your temperament your mood you know your your feelings will be governed by how much money people are giving to you in any moment and when you're an entrepreneur especially starting out people don't want to give you money you know and so for me you know when you start to develop a relationship with what it isn't you're here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about

here to do then the rewards are just they come with your making<br>(03:34) money or not so the more connected we are to purpose the easier it is for us to express that potential do what is it we love and the rewards there in the activity not in the river if not in the consequence so for me a piece of advice that I do it will give on top of those focus on the things that as a natural consequence produce what it is you're looking for you know when you focus on money and what the behavioral science tells us people would focus on money eight times more likely to engage in deceit deception and fraud<br>(03:58) related behavior because they're focusing on money whereas what I prefer to do is to focus on the activity or that which in my case is the purpose the expression of purpose done in a really sound and intelligent commercial way that is a natural consequence produce money so as a result I don't have to focus on money I just focused on delivering value in a commercially intelligent way and the money takes care of itself and so I'm therefore you know my decision-making my decision-making process is never<br>(04:25) compromised by someone waving a dollar bill in front of me it's it's always going to be governed by the things that are actually genuinely important to me because delivering value when we need to live a value in in a commercially intelligent way you can't help but make money and I was it was Stewart Wall who wrote the book the trick to money is having some when you have the ability to raise people's energy you know to a level where they feel better about themselves they will break down doors<br>(04:50) they'll climb through windows they'll break through walls in order to spend time with you all you need then as a billing system [Music] you

            "text": "Rewrite this text in 500 words: \"There\u2019s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we\u2019re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us \u2018us,\u2019 we\u2019ve got a lot to say.\nWhile you don\u2019t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where \u2018foundered\u2019 sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more \u2018clinker\u2019 than \u2018beezer\u2019? Or appreciating that \u2018grand\u2019 can mean exactly that or anything but?\nIf the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really important,\u201d says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language.\n\u201cI think sometimes we\u2019re not sure even the meaning of slang and the meaning of the vernacular and the colloquial. Especially for Northern Ireland, where language is often so divisive, we forget how a rich and varied it is. And sometimes we find other places in the world that really value the mix of their language.\n\u201cOften the things that we associate with slang are actually part of the sort of the languages that make up what we think of as English because we have this wonderful mixture of English, Scots language, and Irish, all bubbling up together and then you have the additions on that, of slang,\u201d he continues.\n\u201cSlang as a sort of term that\u2019s used by certain groups to denote certain things through phrases.\n\u201cWe have an incredible mix and you think how small in many ways Northern Ireland is, that there are marked differences in the language that Belfast uses and the language that\u2019s used up in Derry. There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they\u2019re really quite amazing things.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a potentially massive term,\u201d says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.\n\u201cOne of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.\n\u201cBut then you\u2019ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he\u2019s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.\u201d\nLanguage has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we\u2019re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you\u2019re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like \u2018yer ma\u2019, or \u2018yer man\u2019 and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don\u2019t and can\u2019t,\u201d says Dr Ferguson.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there\u2019s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.\n\u201cSometimes we might get anxious that we\u2019re using cliches, but we\u2019re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.\u201d\nThink too of Line of Duty\u2019s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn\u2019t come up the Lagan in a bubble.\nIn popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee\u2019s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.\n\u201cThat really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.\n\u201cSometimes we\u2019ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.\u201d\nBut our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s unfortunate that it\u2019s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,\u201d says Gail.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating but I think there\u2019s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It\u2019s one dimension of what slang can do.\u201d\nDr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.\n\u201cIn many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.\n\u201cWe have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.\n\u201cWe are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for \u2018potatoes\u2019 that we have.\n\u201cCertain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that\u2019s a real strength. I think there\u2019s a variety there and there\u2019s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.\u201d\nAgain, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a \u2018boak\u2019 after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done \u2018the messages\u2019? My favourite slang word \u2018hoke\u2019 has an Ulster Scots origin. It\u2019s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.\n\u201cOften there\u2019s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it\u2019s bad language, or it doesn\u2019t have a sense of value behind it,\u201d says Dr Ferguson.\n\u201cBut on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.\n\u201cThere are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it\u2019s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you\u2019re in the room.\n\u201cWhenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns\u2019 To a Mouse and \u2018wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim\u2019rous beastie\u2019 appears in the first line.\n\u201cThis really electrifies him because the word \u2018wee\u2019 appears. It\u2019s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it\u2019s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.\n\u201cI think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we\u2019ve grown up with, we\u2019re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there\u2019s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don\u2019t connect us.\u201d\nSlang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we\u2019re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland\u2019s case, that we have multiple uses for the word \u2018wee.\u2019\n\u201cWe all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it\u2019s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we\u2019re foundered,\u201d says Dr Ferguson.\n\u201cOne of our great words, and I think there\u2019s a difference between the town and city where it\u2019s \u2018scunnered\u2019 or \u2018scundered\u2019. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of \u2018I am totally scunnered\u2019 or \u2018I am totally scundered\u2019 about something. These are things that we should protect.\u201d\nLanguage too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.\n\u201cYesterday\u2019s slang term is today or the future\u2019s commonly understood term for something,\u201d she explains.\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You\u2019re getting a people\u2019s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.\n\u201cEvery year I\u2019m always interested to see what makes it into the OED \u2014 it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.\n\u201cIn 2022, \u2018a chara\u2019 entered the OED. So did \u2018fluthered\u2019, first used by James Joyce in 1927, \u2018gaslighter\u2019 and \u2018vaxxed\u2019. It\u2019s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we\u2019re living through.\u201d\nSimilarly, Dr Ferguson says the \u2018beauty\u2019 of slang is that it\u2019s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.\n\u201cIt often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,\u201d he laughs.\n\u201cBut there\u2019s a there\u2019s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They\u2019re used in some circles and in some groups.\n\u201cWe all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we\u2019ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, \u2018uni\u2019 seems one of the obvious words to use because it\u2019s been floating through media, but it\u2019s loaded into everyday speech.\n\u201cLanguage is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we\u2019re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.\u201d\nThe phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they\u2019re widely available for visitors to enjoy \u2014 on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.\nLinzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s actually gotten more popular,\u201d she says of the slang-adorned items.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.\n\u201cI think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.\u201d\nShe launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we\u2019re proud of the places we call home.\nFrom \u2018up to high doh\u2019 coasters to \u2018a wee bag\u2019 tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.\n\u201cI knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast \u2014 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,\u201d explains Linzi.\n\u201cWith the Americans coming over and they ask, \u2018What\u2019s \u201cawk hiya love?\u201d\u2019 \u2013 which we have on our socks and mugs \u2013 once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they\u2019re running around America with a pair of \u2018awk hiya love\u2019 socks on with people asking, \u2018What\u2019s awk?\u2019\n\u201cIt creates engagement in the shop and it\u2019s probably why the shop is doing so well as it\u2019s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.\n\u201cIt opens conversations which is brilliant.\u201d\nTop of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with \u2018alright big lad\u2019 and customers still love \u2018Ulster says yeooo!\u2019 and \u2018ats us nai\u2019.\n\u201cHaving tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,\u201d continues Linzi.\n\u201cFor the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.\nThere\u2019s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.\u201d\nHow a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.\n\u201cI was always very conscious that it\u2019s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it\u2019s a lifestyle brand. When you do that and add a bit of Northern Irish tongue in cheek, it\u2019s quite popular.\n\u201cIt may not want to be a mug you\u2019d have in your house but when you add the pink and enamel and people will take pictures of it up the Mournes or are wearing their \u2018alright\u2019 sock in a style that\u2019s trendy and you can see yourself wearing it. If you\u2019re able to tie those two together then you\u2019ve got a good product. It\u2019s not just your fridge magnet with a leprechaun on it.\u201d\nMany households live with multiple words of various things, giving a flavour of the melting point of cultures and nationalities for whom Northern Ireland is home.\n\u201cI\u2019m married to an American so occasionally with our young son, Beth and I are in disagreement about the things we say,\u201d says Gail. \u201cSimple things like I\u2019ll say \u2018plaster\u2019 and she\u2019ll say \u2018Band-aid,\u2019 I\u2019ll say \u2018chips\u2019 and she\u2019ll say \u2018fries\u2019. He knows that he\u2019s betwixt and between terms.\n\u201cEven things like \u2018wee\u2019 and \u2018what\u2019s the craic?\u2019 There are phrases I would say that, in the mouth of someone who\u2019s not from here, they sound ridiculous. You can hear people, and English speakers in particular, trying to accommodate themselves, \u2018Well, hello, what\u2019s the craic?\u2019 Or even words like \u2018scundered\u2019 or \u2018jammy,\u2019 or \u2018dead on,\u2019 all these things that I say quite often.\u201d\"\n",

            "prompt": "Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nRewrite this text in 500 words: \"There\u2019s much that divides us in Northern Ireland though one thing is guaranteed to bring us together: local phrases. Call it slang, call it colloquialisms, we all know only too well how important words are to where we\u2019re from . . . and when it comes to the phrases that make us \u2018us,\u2019 we\u2019ve got a lot to say.\nWhile you don\u2019t need advance knowledge of the words to fit in, well, it helps. How else will you know where \u2018foundered\u2019 sits on the scale of warm to freezing? Or deciding whether that new car purchase is more \u2018clinker\u2019 than \u2018beezer\u2019? Or appreciating that \u2018grand\u2019 can mean exactly that or anything but?\nIf the best way to get to know a nation is to understand their language, then surely tourists must be at times confused about what comes out of our mouths. Throughout the island of Ireland, we have utterly brilliant ways to verbally express ourselves.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really important,\u201d says Dr Frank Ferguson, research director for English Language and Literature at Ulster University, about the vitality of slang as part of language.\n\u201cI think sometimes we\u2019re not sure even the meaning of slang and the meaning of the vernacular and the colloquial. Especially for Northern Ireland, where language is often so divisive, we forget how a rich and varied it is. And sometimes we find other places in the world that really value the mix of their language.\n\u201cOften the things that we associate with slang are actually part of the sort of the languages that make up what we think of as English because we have this wonderful mixture of English, Scots language, and Irish, all bubbling up together and then you have the additions on that, of slang,\u201d he continues.\n\u201cSlang as a sort of term that\u2019s used by certain groups to denote certain things through phrases.\n\u201cWe have an incredible mix and you think how small in many ways Northern Ireland is, that there are marked differences in the language that Belfast uses and the language that\u2019s used up in Derry. There are gradation and the usage of words and phrases that we often take for granted but they\u2019re really quite amazing things.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a potentially massive term,\u201d says Gail McConnell, a writer from Belfast on slang which she says transcends distinctions of high and low culture.\n\u201cOne of the reasons why so many of us love [TV show] Derry Girls so much is because it was a language, phrasing and words and speech, that was so familiar, and took such a delight and pleasure in not just Northern Irish slang but Derry-specific slang, which was a joyous thing to see on a Channel 4 programme.\n\u201cBut then you\u2019ve got someone like Pulitzer Prize-winning Paul Muldoon, the current Ireland Chair of Poetry, whose poems are peppered with slang terms, through all the decades of his writing; he\u2019s been doing that since the 1970s and 1980s to now.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really interesting legacy of this place and the words that make us unique.\u201d\nLanguage has the power to unite: it brings familiarity, a sense of community and a feeling that we\u2019re all in this together. It is our primary tool to communicate and finding those lines of unity is vital to create bonds and friendships.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that if we go on holiday and you\u2019re walking down the street, whether it be Spain or wherever, and you hear something from home. It can be something like \u2018yer ma\u2019, or \u2018yer man\u2019 and that will convey a whole host of knowledge and sense of place that somethings don\u2019t and can\u2019t,\u201d says Dr Ferguson.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something very unmistakeably ours about words and phrases that we use and there\u2019s nothing more honest at times and nothing more radical.\n\u201cSometimes we might get anxious that we\u2019re using cliches, but we\u2019re actually using things that are very unguarded in our speech.\u201d\nThink too of Line of Duty\u2019s Ted Hastings, who may be not living in Northern Ireland but ensures his team appreciate he didn\u2019t come up the Lagan in a bubble.\nIn popular culture, like Gail, Dr Ferguson also references Lisa McGee\u2019s Derry Girls that unashamedly used phrases and terminology from this place.\n\u201cThat really said something of the exceptionalism of who we are and what we say.\n\u201cSometimes we\u2019ve been too quick almost to laugh at ourselves for those words, because I think a lot of it is the way society tries to engineer us with an idea of what is proper language, whereas what we say communicates extremely effectively and works better than sometimes the phraseology of standard English.\u201d\nBut our local phrases are not immune from what goes on here.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s unfortunate that it\u2019s been politicised by a face-off between the Irish language and Ulster Scots,\u201d says Gail.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating but I think there\u2019s definitely more that we have in common. I think people are often not that sure of the history of slang terms, what the root of it is and where it started.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s such a source of comedy; I think some of the best of Irish writing, such as James Joyce, used slang. It\u2019s one dimension of what slang can do.\u201d\nDr Ferguson agrees, citing the number of creative writers that Northern Ireland produces who understand the power and ability of language in putting across a moment, or series of moments.\n\u201cIn many ways, we have a number of registers coming through to us all the time.\n\u201cWe have that historic mix of English, Scots and Irish, which means then that we can often have two or three words for the same thing.\n\u201cWe are like the cliche of the Eskimos having so many words for snow; there are, it seems, lots and lots of words out there for \u2018potatoes\u2019 that we have.\n\u201cCertain areas will have a certain word for certain things and that\u2019s a real strength. I think there\u2019s a variety there and there\u2019s a wonderful history to where those words came from. And even at times, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve even grasped yet the opportunities that that has for who we are and what we can do and where we can go with that.\u201d\nAgain, Ulster Scots is mentioned: a language so many of us use without even knowing. Anyone ever had a \u2018boak\u2019 after a foodstuff not agreeing with them or done \u2018the messages\u2019? My favourite slang word \u2018hoke\u2019 has an Ulster Scots origin. It\u2019s fair to say that a discussion on Northern Irish slang cannot be done without looking at Ulster Scots and its continued impact.\n\u201cOften there\u2019s not a lot of prestige placed on something like Ulster Scots because there is a perception that it\u2019s bad language, or it doesn\u2019t have a sense of value behind it,\u201d says Dr Ferguson.\n\u201cBut on one hand, you can trace Ulster Scots back into the courtly language of Scotland and you can also get the sense of the authentic place.\n\u201cThere are bad Ulster Scots writers, just as there are bad Irish writers or bad English writers, or bad French or bad Spanish writers. But when it\u2019s authentic and done well, it transports you to a real sense of realisation that this is really important and fantastic literature and you\u2019re in the room.\n\u201cWhenever anybody questions me about the validity of Ulster Scots, I say go to Seamus Heaney and he talks about reading [poet] Rabbie Burns\u2019 To a Mouse and \u2018wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim\u2019rous beastie\u2019 appears in the first line.\n\u201cThis really electrifies him because the word \u2018wee\u2019 appears. It\u2019s the word that he hears at home in his kitchen language as he calls it and it\u2019s also the word that miraculously appears in the world of art and literature and anthologies.\n\u201cI think this is when we realised that the very simple words we think we\u2019ve grown up with, we\u2019re maybe a little anxious to use them. When you see the possibilities for those words, there\u2019s something that really brings us home to just how marvellous our language actually is. And actually how it connects us with lots of people in the country at times when there are things that don\u2019t connect us.\u201d\nSlang has a special place in painting a vivid image of what it is we\u2019re trying to say. It also gives us an insight into a specific culture and attitude. In Northern Ireland\u2019s case, that we have multiple uses for the word \u2018wee.\u2019\n\u201cWe all know how good a wee cup of tea is, a wee rest or a wee drink or a wee day off. These all have their meanings. It can be cold or be freezing but when it\u2019s Baltic, we know exactly what that means and we know we\u2019re foundered,\u201d says Dr Ferguson.\n\u201cOne of our great words, and I think there\u2019s a difference between the town and city where it\u2019s \u2018scunnered\u2019 or \u2018scundered\u2019. You can be annoyed and you can be frustrated, but nothing hits home [than] the sense of \u2018I am totally scunnered\u2019 or \u2018I am totally scundered\u2019 about something. These are things that we should protect.\u201d\nLanguage too is continuously developing. There are times too when a slang word enters the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) and becomes almost standardised, says Gail.\n\u201cYesterday\u2019s slang term is today or the future\u2019s commonly understood term for something,\u201d she explains.\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s how language changes and evolves, through its users. You\u2019re getting a people\u2019s history of language use when you think about slang terms. All language passes through users.\n\u201cEvery year I\u2019m always interested to see what makes it into the OED \u2014 it tells you a lot about the way we speak now and how the dictionary has to keep up with the language that people are using.\n\u201cIn 2022, \u2018a chara\u2019 entered the OED. So did \u2018fluthered\u2019, first used by James Joyce in 1927, \u2018gaslighter\u2019 and \u2018vaxxed\u2019. It\u2019s great to see Irish English there and words that reflect what we\u2019re living through.\u201d\nSimilarly, Dr Ferguson says the \u2018beauty\u2019 of slang is that it\u2019s often at the cutting edge of where words enter into common parlance.\n\u201cIt often comes from young people so that there is a sense that if somebody like me is using the word, it has long lost its kind of cachet,\u201d he laughs.\n\u201cBut there\u2019s a there\u2019s a real sense that this is how words get born and taken into language. They\u2019re used in some circles and in some groups.\n\u201cWe all talk about going to uni now and in a sense, this is Australian dialect that we\u2019ve picked up when Neighbours came along in the 1980s. Suddenly, \u2018uni\u2019 seems one of the obvious words to use because it\u2019s been floating through media, but it\u2019s loaded into everyday speech.\n\u201cLanguage is always a kind of magpie; it always throws up things for us to use that we\u2019re not expected to use. Even terms that maybe in the past would have had specific meanings for specific groups, suddenly, this becomes widespread.\u201d\nThe phrases we barely think about, so bound are they to our identity, are not just ours, however, they\u2019re widely available for visitors to enjoy \u2014 on a sock or enamel mug, among other things.\nLinzi Rooney is the owner of Born and Bred, a shop celebrating homeware and apparel with a decidedly local twist.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s actually gotten more popular,\u201d she says of the slang-adorned items.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more of a pride and a confidence that has built up from locals because of who we are and where we come from.\n\u201cI think that confidence has grown given the number of tourists who are coming into the city. They talk about how friendly we are, they talk about our hospitality and are genuinely interested in the history of the north of Ireland. I think then that our confidence has grown which makes us take a bit more pride in our kind of phrases.\u201d\nShe launched the business in 2014 and her ethos remains changing the often negative attitudes about Northern Ireland, creating a culture where we\u2019re proud of the places we call home.\nFrom \u2018up to high doh\u2019 coasters to \u2018a wee bag\u2019 tote, Born and Bred is proudly Northern Irish and equally proud of our famous sayings.\n\u201cI knew locals would love it and if you see the amount of actual tourists we have coming into the store in Belfast \u2014 27% of our tourism comes from Scotland and England,\u201d explains Linzi.\n\u201cWith the Americans coming over and they ask, \u2018What\u2019s \u201cawk hiya love?\u201d\u2019 \u2013 which we have on our socks and mugs \u2013 once you explain it to them, they then love it and they buy it. So they\u2019re running around America with a pair of \u2018awk hiya love\u2019 socks on with people asking, \u2018What\u2019s awk?\u2019\n\u201cIt creates engagement in the shop and it\u2019s probably why the shop is doing so well as it\u2019s creating that kind of dialogue with tourists in the shop as opposed to going in, buying something and leaving.\n\u201cIt opens conversations which is brilliant.\u201d\nTop of the festive socks for 2022 was a pair with \u2018alright big lad\u2019 and customers still love \u2018Ulster says yeooo!\u2019 and \u2018ats us nai\u2019.\n\u201cHaving tourists back last year and also cruise ships was definitely a real confidence boost for the shop,\u201d continues Linzi.\n\u201cFor the last two years before that, in and around lockdowns, you were relying on local trade which was amazing.\nThere\u2019s no greater feeling than somebody coming from Spain, China, Italy, America, Canada, and really loving something with a local sign on it.\u201d\nHow a brand markets items with such a local angle is important, she says.\n\u201cI was always very conscious that it\u2019s how you incorporate this kind of slang with your brand, and create a brand that people want to invest in and it\u2019s a lifestyle brand.

This section should not take you an entire week.\n- Installing and Using Python\nIn this module you will set things up so you can write Python programs. Not all activities in this module are required for this class so please read the \"Using Python in this Class\" material for details.\n- Chapter One: Why We Program (continued)\nIn the first chapter we try to cover the \"big picture\" of programming so you get a \"table of contents\" of the rest of the book. Don't worry if not everything makes perfect sense the first time you hear it. This chapter is quite broad and you would benefit from reading the chapter in the book in addition to watching the lectures to help it all sink in. You might want to come back and re-watch these lectures after you have funished a few more chapters.\n- Chapter Two: Variables and Expressions\nIn this chapter we cover how a program uses the computer's memory to store, retrieve and calculate information.\n- Chapter Three: Conditional Code\nIn this section we move from sequential code that simply runs one line of code after another to conditional code where some steps are skipped. It is a very simple concept - but it is how computer software makes \"choices\".\n- Chapter Four: Functions\nThis is a relatively short chapter. We will learn about what functions are and how we can use them. The programs in the first chapters of the book are not large enough to require us to develop functions, but as the book moves into more and more complex programs, functions will be an essential way for us to make sense of our code.\n- Chapter Five: Loops and Iteration\nLoops and iteration complete our four basic programming patterns. Loops are the way we tell Python to do something over and over. Loops are the way we build programs that stay with a problem until the problem is solved."

As the battery is used the voltage will decrease until the voltage is not enough to run the application ( E.g. a red LED) and will be called 'dead' . But a Dead battery still has some power remaining in it - just not enough voltage. The trick is to use some of that remaining power to increase the voltage in a circuit. The trade off being there will be a reduction in current.\nHere is the required steps:\n1- Connect a switch to a battery holder. A soldiering iron and hot glue gun assisted with this.\n2- Make a small pyramid above the battery holder using 4 bamboo skewer sticks secured with hot glue.\n3- Soldier on a 1.8 volt red LED at the top of the mini Christmas tree.\n4- Test the LED glows with a new battery (1.6 volts)\n5- Test the LED doesn't glow with a dead battery (1.2 volts)\n6- Add in the buzzer circuit, along with a switch.\n7- Add in the windings circuit - to touch the striker of the buzzer a little copper foil was added.\n8- Insert a dead battery (1.2 volt) with the buzzer circuit turned switch off - the LED will not glow but when the buzzer circuit is switched on the Red LED lights up."

It also needs to rotate on itself. Bend up the outer tab into a L shape using some pilers and then bend it forward so a piece of string can hang from it over the center of the can. This will allow the can to rotate on itself. Close the pouring opening by using a knife or other thin object, bending the opening back up so it almost where it was before the beverage can was opened.\nStep 2: Nozzel Jets\nMake a couple of holes in the side of the can, about half way up, opposite each other using a small drill. The diameter of the holes should be about the same as the thin plastic tubing to be used as jet nozzles. Enlarge the holes so they are elliptical allowing the nozzle tubes to lie parallel against the cans side.\nStep 3: Making a Pressure Vessel\nSeal the top of the opened can using super glue and baking soda to make a small pressure vessel. Add some super glue to the closed opening and then sprinkle on some baking soda - they will combine to make a plastic. Keep adding super glue and baking soda until the top is sealed.\nStep 4: Attaching the Nozzle Jets\nFit in the thin plastic tubes to the holes drilled in the sides of the can and seal with super glue and baking soda. Try to have the tubes pointing horizontal in the direction you want to rotate the can when the steam exits the nozzles.\nStep 5: Creating Steam\nAdd a little water into the can though one of the nozzles. Just add maybe a teaspoon or so. \nStep 6: In Action\nThe can was suspended from a tripod over the methylated sprits flame. After a couple of minutes enough steam had built up to rotate the can."

At the start of the novel, the light symbolizes Gatsby's unwavering love for Daisy. He stands at the end of the dock gazing across the bay, reaching for the light, waiting for Daisy to come back to him. His hope, like the eternal green light, is unfaltering. It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip. Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love. This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money. Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel. This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular. Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it. As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream. After Gatsby is murdered, the green light is symbolic of the ways that money and affluence ruin the lives of those without. It is also symbolic of the way that the American dream ruins the lives of those eternally reaching for it."

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains.
